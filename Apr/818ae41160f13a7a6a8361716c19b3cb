It has been nearly a month since South Africa went into lockdown to flatten the curve in the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. The media has played a significant role in helping citizens to understand and navigate this challenging time where data shows that most coverage was around various issues from economic impact, announcements by government and ways for the nation to function. In the fourth release of weekly research by Ornico, media data analysis shows that – out of a sample of 4 838 media items collected – the most syndicated coverage continues to talk to the economic impact of the pandemic. The data analysed was collected from online, print and broadcast sources from 15-21 April 2020. Newspaper and online coverage account for 81% of mentions in
the sample data analysed with online media contributing 59% of all coverage. The
past week’s media analysis shows Media24’s Riana de Lange, Elvira Wood and
Hendrik Cronje to feature as leading journalists. IOL journalists took the lead
weekly for the first three weeks of the lockdown media research, which now
reflects Media24 in the latest results. Brand Intelligence firm Ornico has committed its resources to assist the communication industry and will be working closely with the Public Relations Institute of Southern Africa (PRISA) and other industry role players to help understand reportage around the pandemic. This will help professional communicators to improve critical messaging and to direct it to relevant audiences.
