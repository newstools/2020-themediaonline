Why has the current Covid-19 crisis led to such an explosion of fake news? What should be done about it? We’ve seen lots of fact-checking stories, some criminal charges, technical solutions and others – what’s working? How should journalism respond? Is this perhaps an unrecognised opportunity for journalism to rebuild trust with audiences? These are just some of the questions we need to consider. You’re invited to join students and staff of
