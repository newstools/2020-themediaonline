The MultiChoice Talent Factory (MTF) in partnership with the Dolby Institute have launched an online learning channel, Dolby Audio Webinars. Kicking off on Thursday, 16 April, the series of webinars covers a range of topics such Sound for Video Editors, Setting-Up a 5.1 Session & Mix Environment, Dolby Atmos Content Creation and other sound engineering topics. The first of the eight planned webinars will go live every Thursday, with the first session focusing on Script Analysis & Planning for 5.1 Productions. This  is one of four webinars geared towards all content creators while the others are more technical and designed for mix engineers, video editors and system integrators. In filmmaking, sound is often overlooked yet it’s an
important component of filmmaking. The Dolby Institute develops educational
programming to help creatives advance in the art of storytelling, whether
they’re making a film, mixing the sound for a sporting event, or designing the
next-generation music experiences. MultiChoice recognises the importance of understanding sound in order to tell authentic African stories. This partnership with Dolby will benefit storytellers across the continent and support the growth of the homegrown entertainment industry. Below are
details of upcoming webinars: NOTE: The recorded webinar series will be made available on the portal the day after, so log on to www.multichoicetalentfactory.com to keep learning.
