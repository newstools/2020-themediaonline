We value our readers, and we truly value their insights. As a publication catering to South Africa’s community of media professionals, we are extending our online and magazine offerings. We are soon to launch The Media Lounge, a live and interactive video-driven forum for our readers to discuss the issues challenging the sector and offer insights into possible solutions. We have a host, we have the venue, now we want your input. But
before we go ahead, we’d like YOUR ideas on the topics you’d like to lay bare.
We want to crowd source your views on the issues we face, on the subjects you
would like to know more about, on ad technology, advertising, the different
media sectors, social media, television, planning and strategy, the impact of
the pandemic… There’s
a lot to talk about, and we’d like to facilitate the conversation. Please
drop us a line on tmo.live@gmail.com giving us your ideas, your
name and contact information. Once we have a shortlist, we’ll ask you to vote
in order of priority. The
