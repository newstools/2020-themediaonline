Now in its third year, DStv Media Sales is offering25% bonus airtime for every rand of airtime bought by qualifying small agencies. The aim is primarily to assist small media agencies, and at the same time, help improve and transform the media industry. To qualify, agencies
must: The programme came about after the Competition Tribunal found DStv Media Sales, and a host of other media companies, had contravened the Competition Act after admitting to fixing price and trading conditions. As part of the recompense, companies were ordered to pay into an Economic Development Fund to help develop small black-owned media or advertising agencies, as well as assist black students in the sector. Part of DStv’s deal was to help emerging agencies in terms of airtime. Advertisers are reminded that bonus airtime is scheduled by DStv Media Sales in available inventory, and that DStv Media Sales reserves the right to request any further information in order to confirm that agencies meet the above qualifying criteria. Airtime campaign bookings carry the standard trading
terms and conditions for DStv Media Sales. A copy of the Terms and
Conditions are found on the DStv Media Sales website.
