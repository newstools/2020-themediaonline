Despite the dramas at SABC, the past five years has seen significant growth in broadcasting, in audiences, choices and revenue. The National Association of Broadcasters released its latest State of the Broadcasting Industry Report late in 2019. These are the headlines. There is no doubt the period between 2015 and 2018 was a turbulent time for broadcasting, not least due to ongoing issues at the SABC, and the continued impact of technological developments. It was
against this backdrop that the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB)
researched its State of the Broadcasting Industry Report, the first edition of
which was released in 2014 as South Africa celebrated its first 20 years of
democracy. The
second report, issued in November 2019, was the result of PricewaterhouseCoopers
research into what has happened in the five years since then, as South Africa
marked 25 years since the landmark democratic elections in 1994. As the
CEO of the NAB, Nadia Bulbilia, says, “It provides clear indicators of the
contribution made by broadcasters to the economy through job creation, local
content creation and investment in infrastructure. It presents reliable data to
inform and shape future broadcasting policy and identifies gaps for ongoing
industry research”. NAB
chairperson, Philly Moilwa, is upbeat. As he says in the introduction to the
report, “The democratisation of broadcasting has enabled the public to enjoy
and engage with more services, channels and programmes, in more languages and
more genres than ever before. Overall, the story of broadcasting in our
democracy is a good one.” Still
on the radar, as it has been since 2015, is South Africa’s switch to digital
migration. The national analogue switch-off process, which was approved 11
years ago, was revised in 2018, with the deadline having recently been extended
to July 2020. The
State of the Broadcasting Industry Report is based on responses from NAB
members: Five from television, 39 from radio and three from signal
distributors. We have highlighted some key numbers in this story, but the
entire report is available from the NAB. South Africa had three commercial
subscription licensed television operators (StarSat, Deukom and MultiChoice),
two free-to-air (FTA) operators (SABC and e.tv) and five community television
broadcasters, (1 KZN TV, Cape Community Television, Soweto Community
Television, Faith Broadcasting Terrestrial (former TBN) and Tshwane Community
Television), who collectively offer 62 high definition channels and over 236
standard definition (SD) channels to an audience of 38.2 million people. Of the
14.4 million TV households in the country, 55% are analogue FTA viewers, with
the remainder being satellite based. Average daily listening time on
radio averaged out at 3h36 in 2018. A weekly audience of almost 36 million
people tune into radio via a variety of devices, listening to 24 commercial
stations (21 private and three SABC public/commercial), 16 SABC public service
broadcasting stations (including Channel Africa) and 264 community stations. Seventy-one
percent listen on standalone radios, but this percentage is steadily declining
as cellphones (33%), vehicle radio (24%), TV (13%) and computer streaming (2%)
listening become more popular. Revenue from TV advertising has
grown from R6.6 billion in 2014 to R7.5 billion in 2018, reflecting a 3.3%
compound annual growth rate CAGR in comparison to the 14.0% CAGR of the
pre-2014 period. Historically,
the report said, TV was the largest advertising segment by revenue, but this is
being challenged by internet advertising, predicted to overtake television by
2022. Radio’s advertising revenue grew
from R3.9 billion in 2014 to R4.2 billion at a CAGR of 2.3%, in comparison to
the 12.7% CAGR of the pre-2014 period. While radio’s greatest strength is its
ability to reach a large-scale audience, the ability to deliver targeted
content to more specific groups of people needs to be understood and developed,
NAB recommended. Radio
has shown “slightly slower growth over the past four years” but has been “aided
by the rise of community stations to remain prominent, as music streaming and
podcasts begin to enter the market”. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, NAB
says, as while streaming and podcasts do compete with radio “they also drive a
culture of listening and the spoken word” and as such, contributed to radio’s
continued relevance. R2.32 billion: That’s how much in
licence fees, levies and other contributions TV broadcasters brought in over
the period 2015 – 2018. Subscriptions to pay-TV were the main drivers to
overall growth in revenue, with an additional 1.5 million households expected
to sign up between 2018 and 2022. However, the NAB warns, this is expected to
slow “as the cultural shift towards on-demand, personalised content via
streaming services gains traction”. FTA channels are still the mainstay
of viewers, with the top five most-watched TV shows in 2018 all being on FTA
channels. E.tv’s satellite broadcaster, Openview, which launched at the end of
2013, has shown significant growth over the last two years. “In the 12 months
to September 2018, its customer base grew 42%, and in March 2019 reported 1.6
million active set-top boxes”. Total contributions from radio
businesses over the period 2015 – 2018 in respect of licences, levies and other
fiscal contributions amounted to R700 million, substantially higher than the
R471 million over the period 2012- 2014. “This increase is primarily driven by
Needletime Royalties following the Supreme Court of Appeal ruling in 2014 on
the Needletime formula, which came into effect during the 2015 – 2018 period,”
the NAB reported. Signal distributors have over the past four years contributed R568
million in the form of taxes and other fees and levies. Want to continue this conversation on The Media Online platforms? Comment on Twitter @MediaTMO or on our Facebook page. Send us your suggestions, comments, contributions or tip-offs via e-mail to glenda.nevill@cybersmart.co.za.
