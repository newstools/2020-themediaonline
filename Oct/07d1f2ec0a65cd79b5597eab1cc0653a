[PRESS OFFICE] Provantage Media Group has taken its digital offering to the next level with the launch of ‘Sonar’, an audience powered mobile geo-location offering that will allow for the extension of campaigns from out-of-home (OOH) into the digital realm. PMG, through its various divisions, will be offering
this geo-location service to all its campaigns to create additional reach, fostering
a greater integration of OOH and mobile, and offering brands the opportunity to
drive more personalised engagement and a closer connection with consumers. This follows PMG signing an exclusive agreement with Africa Media Alliance that will see it roll out Sonar across all its divisions, with a focus on PMG’s digital platforms, in the form of its digital place-based networks and digital boards. Africa
Media Alliance is the sub-Saharan Africa venture partner of global behavioral
and location intelligence technology platform, TAPTAP Digital,
having launched the TAPTAP product in South Africa in 2019. TAPTAP leverages geospatial technology and artificial
intelligence for multi-dimensional audience planning, omni-channel media
activation, and advanced online and offline measurement. “This venture is the result of extensive research into finding the right partner (with an advanced technology stack, deep audiences and scale into many markets?) and has been driven by the growing link between OOH and mobile. The link is further enhanced through the ability of pairing geo-locational technology with campaign roll-outs in order to deliver even more effective solutions for brands,” says Jacques du Preez, CEO of Provantage Media Group. “It is well known now that OOH and mobile integration drive brand lift, recall and ROI, and we’re excited to be able to offer our existing and future clients a world-class mobile integration service alongside our various OOH platforms. This will change the OOH landscape in Africa.” The
TAPTAP technology focuses on three key platform utilities: Applying
these principles to PMG’s new Sonar product, it will allow for campaigns
delivered within the airport space, for example, to extend their reach using
location-powered mobile Out-of-Home. “By geo-fencing airports, malls, golf courses, billboards, commuter nodes  and activation zones  we can drive additional awareness and engagement across the various locations, as well as retarget consumers who have been in these locations, via their mobile devices,” says Du Preez. “Based on the brief, we can build custom audience segments using multiple location-enhanced data points, to effectively amplify specific sites/locations.” What
sets Sonar apart from its competitors and other location-based marketing players
is its access and large footprint.  It is
able to run campaigns in 36 African countries and its total reach across the
continent is over 200 million users and billions of impressions. What this
means is that PMG could provide an integrated OOH and Mobile campaign for a
client that runs concurrently in South Africa, the Ivory Coast and the United
Arab Emirates (Sharjah) – all countries in which PMG has a presence. “We are very excited about this partnership – it
further entrenches TAPTAP as an omni-channel, scalable location intelligence
and technology-rich platform driving business for brands, both big and small,”
says Garth Rhoda, Director of Africa
Media Alliance.
“We were looking for a partner in the OOH space and were attracted to the
Provantage heritage, their innovative approach with their products, and their
diversity in their offering, covering many demographics in the market. We look
forward to assisting more clients in amplifying their messages into the digital
space, focusing on extending the reach and driving engagement and performance
for brands.” Out-of-Home and mobile are increasingly being integrated as
the platforms complement each other, and, if combined, are able to optimise interaction
with an audience and represent an efficient way to maximise reach. In an October 2018 piece titled ‘Case Studies: OOH + Mobile Integration Drive Lift,
Recall, and ROI’, Rainbow Kirby-Stearns and Elizabeth Rave
suggest that “Data + Mobile + OOH = Results.” They go on to cite research shared in Campaign,
which showed that mobile click-through rates increased by up to 15% when
supported by OOH. Additional research from Outsmart stated that better
performing OOH campaigns created a 38% uplift in short-term brand action taken
via mobiles, with 66% of all actions being direct to the brand itself. The days of treating advertising touch points as if each works in
isolation is long past and marketers are being forced to ask themselves which
combinations of ad exposures work best to influence customers. Specifically,
this applies to a consumer segment for which the smartphone has become an ever-present
tool. Marketing Week has predicted that incorporating cell phone
connectivity with OOH will “become the norm, not a ‘special’ part of a campaign”,
and that’s difficult to dispute. PMG
recognises this and is proud of its market-leading Sonar mobile location technology
partnership, which allows it to offer the best in breed to brands to enhance
their campaigns. In doing so, it is putting mobile OOH in the hands of
consumers and giving brands the opportunity to drive greater engagement and
specific, measurable actions. _________________________________________________________________________ Provantage Media Group is one of South Africa’s foremost out-of-home media specialist companies.
