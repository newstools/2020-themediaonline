Seasoned radio personality Carol Ofori is joining East Coast Radio as the new host of the 09:00 to 13:00 daytime slot. In another move, Lucky du Plessis will be taking over the 6:00 to 10:00 Weekend Breakfast slot. The early morning slot is also getting a new
voice. Jane Linley-Thomas will be gracing the
airwavesWeekdays between 01:00 and 04:00 am. East Coast Radio prides itself in growing its own talent and giving budding presenters a springboard to elevate their careers and brands. Minnie Ntuli is one of those talents. She joined the station two years ago and has moved up the ranks from overnight to weekend hosting duties. Ofori is no stranger to the East Coast. KwaZulu-Natal first fell in love with her seven years ago when she hosted the ECR Top 40 for five years. She replaces Thandolwethu, who mutually parted ways with East Coast Radio for health reasons. Ofori says she is excited to be returning home. “When I left East Coast Radio two years ago,
I knew that our paths would cross again, I just never thought it would be this
soon. The Almighty’s timing is always the best timing. Not only is
Durban the best place to be but East Coast Radio is an awesome place to work. “Deciding to come back was easy
because I left on great terms and I love the brand so much. I am so excited to
be back! So, expect loads of fun features and loads of laughs, passion for
African travel, and what is a day without a little bit of gossip,” she said. Du Plessis is looking forward to bringing his flavour and charisma to KZN. “I am very excited to join KZN’s No1 Hit Music Station! I cannot wait to meet the amazing personalities at East Coast Radio and work with passionate and fun people,” he said. “I love a new challenge and I am very excited to connect with the people of KZN, to hear their stories, share mine and together we can start this long beautiful journey.” Ntuli will now host the 19:00 – 22:00 Weekday show. She takes over the slot from Neil Green, who has relocated to Ireland with his family. ECR’s programming manager Zane Derbyshire says the line-up changes will provide a balanced mix of entertainment and presenter talent. “Adding a presenter of Jane’s talent to our weekday overnight line up is a massive coup for the station. Her impact on our streaming station, East Coast Gold, has been impressive and to still find a slot on East Coast Radio that suits her is a win for the business. I’m so thrilled to welcome Lucky du Plessis to the team. “He is an experienced presenter, great
storyteller and will start KZN off on the right note each weekend. Working
alongside him will be the talented Gareth ‘G-Dog’ Jenkinson, who will provide
sport updates. The vivacious Minnie Ntuli will be a treat for our listeners on
weeknights from 7pm. She will bring fun and excitement to night radio and we
look forward to watching her grow in that slot.” Catch these exciting changes on East Coast
